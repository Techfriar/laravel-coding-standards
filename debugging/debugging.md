# Logging and Debugging Methods

## Logging

You can use Laravel's logging facilities to output messages to the log files. Here are examples of how to log messages at different levels:

```php
\Log::info('This is an info message');
\Log::debug('Debugging information');
```

## Debugging

- dd($variable);
- use PHP's var_dump, print_r, or dd (die and dump)
